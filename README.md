**Deploying a Django Application with MySQL on Kubernetes using Docker Desktop**

In this project, I deployed a Django web application integrated with a MySQL database on a local Kubernetes cluster using Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled. The application and database were containerized into individual Docker images and deployed as Kubernetes pods. I configured Deployments for managing pod lifecycle, Services for internal networking, and utilized ConfigMaps and Secrets for dynamic configuration and secure credential management. To ensure data persistence for the MySQL database, I implemented PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC) backed by a local StorageClass. This hands-on deployment enhanced my understanding of container orchestration, pod networking, persistent storage management, and application scaling within Kubernetes. The entire deployment was managed via YAML manifest files. This project has laid a strong foundation for my upcoming plans to integrate load balancers in the cloud, resource limits, Horizontal Pod Autoscaling, and CI/CD pipelines for a complete end-to-end Kubernetes-based application deployment workflow.
